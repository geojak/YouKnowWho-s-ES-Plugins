	description "The Hailstone is a nimble fighter deployed from the Squall, designed by the Stranded to strike fast and vanish just as quickly. Its sleek, leaf-like hull mirrors the organic elegance of its carrier, blending agility with subtle menace. The Hailstone delivers precise bursts of firepower, acting as the swift edge of the Stranded's forgotten fleet."

	description "The Squall is a carrier-class ship used by the Stranded, a faction of Wanderers long separated from their home and forced to adapt in isolation. Its design evokes the image of a massive armored leaf, with flowing, organic curves and a natural green palette, yet hides a powerful core capable of launching swarms of drones and absorbing punishing attacks."
