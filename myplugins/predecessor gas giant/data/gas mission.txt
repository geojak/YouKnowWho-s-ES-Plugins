			`As you land at the grand estate of House Seineq, the station's atmosphere feels tense yet expectant. The Seineq Guard disembarks first, striding ahead to announce your arrival. Taaquvaleq follows, their chromatophores flickering between anxious blues and cautious greens.`
			`Once more, you are led through ornate halls, their towering columns shimmering under the glow of bioluminescent engravings. At the far end of the chamber, the Scion of House Seineq awaits, adorned in elaborate metallic bands that signal both power and tradition.`
			`The Scion of House Seineq extends a limb, their chromatophores shifting to deep violet as they study the recovered isotopes. "Thou return'st, and with that which was promised." The words carry the weight of solemn approval. "A task well-wrought, and well-received."`
			`Their gaze drifts to Taaquvaleq, whose skin flashes bright green-elation-before settling into respectful indigo. "House Seineq doth honor its word. Thee shall have two weight of the isotopes recovered-no more, no less." The Scion's voice turns precise, each syllable measured. "'Tis enough to complete thy craft, yet scarce enough to tempt folly."`
			`"Thy House is most generous," Taaquvaleq murmurs, their limbs curling in a gesture of gratitude. "With but this fraction, I may weave anew what was once lost."`
			`A sudden tension fills the chamber as the Scion steps forward, their chromatophores darkening like storm clouds. "Now, mark this well, travelers." The air grows heavy with unspoken threat. "What thou hast seen, what thou hast taken-none but thee shall know. House Seineq grants thee this yield, but in return, we demand silence."`
			`Behind them, the armored Seineq guard moves with deliberate menace, their segmented plates scraping against each other. "Swear it now," they rumble, the sound vibrating through the damp air, "before the House, before the void itself. No record, no tale, no whispered word beyond these halls."`
			`The Scion's skin ripples black at the edges-a final warning. "The secrets of Avasaa-Aa-Tej are not for the tongues of lesser minds. Speak naught of what transpired, nor of what was found..." They let the pause stretch, their meaning clear. "...lest thou invite ruin upon thine own house."`

			`The spaceport air grows thick as you disembark, the usual hum of activity replaced by unnatural stillness.

The procession stops before a towering figure standing beneath a massive relief of the Predecessors' downfall.

			`They produce a holographic emitter, its flickering light revealing star maps torn asunder. "See here the Tangles - not natural formations, but scars from the Point Drive's ravages. The isotopes within thy drive's heart, the very same that powered our ancestors' ruin, should never have been disturbed again. They were used as fuel-stabilizing catalysts within our Predecessors' burning chambers, and their instability tore apart the fabric of space itself." Their skin pulses with grief-stricken blue. "Thanks to thee, they near their goal."`
