	description "Derived from fragmented knowledge of ancient Predecessor Drives, the Quick Drive is an attempt to refine lost technology into a controlled, practical form. While it lacks the catastrophic power of its predecessor, it retains a shadow of its unique properties-allowing for near-instantaneous hyperspace transitions, even at high velocities. However, the drive's efficiency remains imperfect, demanding significantly more fuel than a standard hyperdrive. The Quick Drives inventor believes that further refinement, perhaps with the very fuel-stabilizing isotopes once used in the original Predecessor Drive, may unlock its full potential."

	description "Derived from fragmented knowledge of the ancient Point Drive, the Quick Drive is an attempt to refine lost technology into a controlled, practical form. While it lacks the catastrophic power of its predecessor, it retains a shadow of its unique properties-allowing for near-instantaneous hyperspace transitions, even at high velocities. Through the integration of recovered Predecessor isotopes as fuel-stabilizing catalysts, the drive has overcome its inefficiencies, drastically reducing its fuel consumption."
