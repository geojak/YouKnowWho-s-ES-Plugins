	description "This Quarg device precisely calibrates a ship's spatial resonance, enabling it to access the advanced portal network that links all completed Quarg Ringworlds. Integrated among Quarg vessels but rarely seen elsewhere, the Gatesyncher is essential for navigating their high-speed transit system technology far beyond the reach of most other species."
