			`Your commlink crackles as Warren's voice comes through, calm but focused. "With the Tubfalet now confirmed, we've expedited deployment of a new Inhibitor Turret design and the Swan, a mobile base-class ship. Both have just passed readiness checks, and you've been cleared to purchase them from our outfitters and shipyards once they are available."`

	description `While cannons that can interfere with a ship's engines are useful in any situation, the Remnant decided that it would be even more useful as a turret that their ships could use to impede those chasing after them.`

	description "Historically, the Remnant have not needed to support remote fleet operations. It had, however, been anticipated as a part of their contingency plans to support large scale evacuations. The first Remnant survived by running, modern Remnant prosper through mobility, and it is expected that the Remnant of the future shall thrive by those same means."
	description "	Thus, the Swan was designed as a mobile base of operations-capable of sustaining extended deployments far from friendly territory. It carries a substantial complement of fighters and drones, extensive storage for supplies and cargo, and the systems necessary to support fleet-wide coordination and defense. In motion or at anchor, the Swan provides the Remnant with a secure and self-sufficient command presence wherever it is needed."
