	description "This ship is a modified Vanguard. The original ship was found floating in deep space, with damage that seemed to be inflicted by it's own heavy rockets. The only person inside was the body of someone holding a crudely sharpend stick. Recently Syndicate Shipyards started mass producing and selling this modified version."
