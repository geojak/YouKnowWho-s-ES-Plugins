planet "Kort Vak'est"
	landscape land/sea16-harro
	attributes urban
	description `Kort Vak'est the twilight jewel of the Stranded, is a planet of sprawling, decaying megacities wrapped in a perpetual haze. Once a beacon of progress, its towering arcologies now crumble under the weight of time, their luminous spires flickering like dying embers. The Stranded, remnants of a once-nomadic species, linger in fractured societies—some clinging to fading traditions, others scavenging among the ruins for a future that never came.`
	spaceport `The main spaceport of Kort Vak'est is a massive, crumbling relic of a once-thriving civilization. Ships come and go, but the port itself remains frozen in time—a monument to a people stranded in their own home.`

	attributes farming 
	description `Var Vak'prai'ek is a tranquil world of rolling amber fields, dense emerald forests, and sky-reflecting lakes. Unlike the crumbling megacities of Kort Vak'est, life here moves at a slower, steadier pace. The Stranded who call it home have long abandoned the ambitions of their ancestors, choosing instead to cultivate the land, tend to their livestock, and preserve what remains of their history through song and craft.`
	spaceport `The lone spaceport of Var Vak'prai'ek, is little more than a cluster of landing pads and a weathered control tower nestled between golden fields.`
