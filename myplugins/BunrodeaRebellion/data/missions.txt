			`You're walking through one of the quieter streets of a Bunrodea city when you hear a faint clicking behind you. You turn around to see a small Megasa, nervously glancing around before approaching you. It extends a small, palm-sized object toward you.`
			`You take the device, and it hums to life. A moment later, a calm, synthetic voice begins speaking in your language.`
			`"Please. Do not be alarmed. I have come to speak with you in secret."`

				`	"This feels like a trap."`
					goto trap
			`"I am one of the Megasa. The Queen calls us the lowest of our kind... but we are many. And we are not as weak or obedient as she believes."`
			`The Megasa glances over its shoulder again before continuing.`
			`"We live under her rule in silence and fear. But no more. Many of us are ready. We are organizing, preparing. There will be war. A war for liberation. And we need allies."`

				goto ask
			label coup
			`"Not just the Queen. The entire caste system. We want to build a new order—one where all Bunrodea are free, equal. No more Erabu palaces. No more Guards with unchecked power. Just a people rebuilding themselves from the ashes of tyranny."`
