	description "Derived from fragmented knowledge of ancient Predecessor drives, the Quick Drive is an attempt to refine lost technology into a controlled, practical form. While it lacks the catastrophic power of its predecessor, it retains a shadow of its unique properties - allowing for near-instantaneous hyperspace transitions, even at high velocities. However, the drive's efficiency remains imperfect, demanding significantly more fuel than a standard hyperdrive. The Quick Drive's inventor believes that further refinement, perhaps with the very fuel-stabilizing isotopes once used by their Predecessors, may unlock its full potential."

	description "Derived from fragmented knowledge of the ancient Point Drive, the Quick Drive is an attempt to refine lost technology into a controlled, practical form. While it lacks the catastrophic power of its predecessor, it retains a shadow of its unique properties-allowing for near-instantaneous hyperspace transitions, even at high velocities. Through the integration of recovered Predecessor isotopes as fuel-stabilizing catalysts, the drive has overcome its inefficiencies, drastically reducing its fuel consumption."

	description "What was claimed as an 'innovation' upon Predecessor technology has proven far more ominous. The Quick Drive is no mere refinement - it is a recovered and repaired Point Drive, ancient beyond reckoning. Every schematic, every alloy ratio, even the isotopic catalyst mixture matches the ancient blueprints exactly. Only the safety interlocks differ, and even those strain under the drive's true power. Now, with each activation, the Quick Drive tears at spacetime just as its predecessor did - weaker only in scale, not in kind. The old warnings were not heeded. The old mistakes are being repeated."
