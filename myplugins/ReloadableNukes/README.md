Vanilla One-Time-Use Nuke:
Unchanged, functions identically to the original game.

Reloadable Nuke Launcher:
Identical stats to the vanilla nuke but can be reloaded.
Unlocks during the Crossroads branch of the Free Worlds storyline (same trigger as the vanilla nuke).
Nuclear Missile Container enables multi-salvo launches when paired with the reloadable launcher.
Additional launchers increase fire rate (stackable effect).
