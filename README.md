<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>In gamerules.txt the following settings are set:



"system departure min" 4000.

The minimum departure distance for all systems. A ship can only jump out of a system if it is further from the system center than the departure distance. If a system has a defined departure distance greater than this value, that value will be used instead.



"system arrival min" 4500.

The minimum arrival distance for all systems. Ships entering a system will exit hyperspace this distance away from their landing target, or the system center if no landing target is selected. If a system has a defined arrival distance greater than this value, that value will be used instead.



"fleet multiplier" 0.75

The global fleet spawn rate multiplier. A value of 2.0 means twice as many random fleets spawn in all systems, while a value of 0.5 means half as many fleets spawn.
